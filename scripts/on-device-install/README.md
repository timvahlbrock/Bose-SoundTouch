# On-Device Installer

Allows to run AfterTouch on SoundTouch devices directly, eliminating the need to run and maintain a separate server on the local network.

## Disclaimer

### Invasiveness

AfterTouch usually normally migrates the SoundTouch devices very noninvasive, by changing the configuration of the device. Running AfterTouch on the device itself is slightly more invasive, because it needs to create a script that starts AfterTouch on boot.

### AfterTouch Availability

Some devices will expose the AfterTouch port, some won't. We currently (May 2026) suspect that the newer generation devices (those with Bluetooth) will expose the port, while the older ones won't. We're still investigating how to expose AfterTouch on all devices. 

If your device doesn't expose the port, you can still use the on-device installer, but you'll need to run AfterTouch on each one of your speakers individually and may only access AfterTouch via ssh port forwarding. This will also make OAuth authentication a little more tricky, but should also work via SSH port forwarding.

### Space Limitation

The storage space on the SoundTouch devices is very limited. At the moment only one AfterTouch installation barely fits on them with enough room for the data it needs to maintain. When installing, make sure that you have removed any binaries and folders of previous installation attempts.

The space limitation also means we are currently unsure on how to update the system, because two binaries are already too large. We are currently working on this - both by checking how we can make the binaries smaller, but also on how we can extend the storage space (e.g. by running AfterTouch from a USB drive).

## Installation

Enable SSH on your SoundTouch device using the usual "Stick with remote_services" method. Connect with the following command.

```bash
ssh -oHostKeyAlgorithms=+ssh-rsa root@<IP_ADDRESS_OF_SPEAKER>
```

Then, run the following command to install AfterTouch on the device.

```bash 
rw && curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gesellix/Bose-SoundTouch/main/scripts/on-device-install/install.sh | sh
```

After the installation check if you can access AfterTouch from your local device by navigating to `http://<IP_ADDRESS_OF_SPEAKER>:8000`. If you can access the AfterTouch UI, you're good to go! If not, you may need to run AfterTouch on the speaker via SSH port forwarding.

```bash
ssh -L 8000:localhost:8000 root@<IP_ADDRESS_OF_SPEAKER>
```

## Updating AfterTouch

In theory updating AfterTouch is just running the installation script again, setting `VERSION` to the newest version (if that hasn't been done in the latest install script already).

```bash
export VERSION=0.123.0
```

In practice, you will almost certainly run into space issues, even if you delete the old binary before. We are currently working on a solution for this.

## Uninstallation

Before uninstall, you might want to revert the migration, especially the changes to the server URLs (even though having configured an unresponsive local server probably is about as bad as having configured unresponsive Bose servers). To uninstall AfterTouch, run the following command on the speaker.

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gesellix/Bose-SoundTouch/main/scripts/on-device-install/uninstall.sh | sh
```
